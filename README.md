# Automated-Mail-Sender

In progress: This system automatically logs in and scrapes data from [BITS Notice Board](https://onboard.bits-pilani.ac.in/), then sends it as an email. 

Potential improvements/todos for future reference:

1. Extract the content directly in HTML format, rather than separating images and texts.
2. Integrate with AWS to ensure continuous operation, store the last message sent, and only forward new updates thereafter.
