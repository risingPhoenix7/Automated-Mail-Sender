# Automated-Mail-Sender
In progress, a quick and useful project.

This system automatically logs in and scrapes data from [BITS Notice Board](https://onboard.bits-pilani.ac.in/), then sends it as an email. 

Potential improvements/todos for future reference:

1. Handle the few remaining bugs in image size handling.
2. Integrate with AWS to ensure continuous operation, store the last message sent, and only forward new updates thereafter.
